# Government debt visualizations
## 1. Government debt trends
The government debt has been increasing in most of the countries. Among other countries, the rising trends of Japan, USA and some of the European countries are noticable.

## 2. Japan's debt mountain: How is it sustainable?
Japan carries a colossal level of government debt that is about 2.3 times higher than its GDP. To mitigate this crisis, Japan keeps government bond yields extremely low and the confidence level of investors high so that it can avoid default.

## 3. A Threat to the Livelihood of the EU?
Eurozone countries are casting doubts on the single currency policy due to the economic troubles that PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain) are experiencing now. They are also skeptical about the fact that they are not able to adjust their economic policy in a way that suits the country's economic needs.

# Let's talk about my visualizations
The second chart was made by the interactive chart feature offered directly at OECD data website. I was not able to manipulate the chart in a way that I wanted to present the data because the OECD website provided only a basic filtering and highlighting option. Therefore, I used this data to highlight Japan which l could display well enough with the available feature. 

The first, third and fourth charts were made by Flourish. In comparison to OECD data website, Flourish provided a wide range of customization options. The grid line chart was useful to compare each timeline in different countries, making it serves as the intro to the problem area. I also noticed that southern european countries were suffering more from debts, represented as PIGS. The area chart might have been the best visualization option to show these countries have relatively more debts than other countries. However, I also realized that the Y axis would not be an absolute value (represented as the amount of debts) but the ratio. I decided not to make the area chart which mathematically does not make sense. 

I still thought the bar chart would be the best method to compare the trend between PIGS and other Eurozone countries. I focused on making PIGS stand out from other countries. Also I added the map of Europe, color coded by the amount of debts, to emphasize that southern european countries are suffering more from this issue.
