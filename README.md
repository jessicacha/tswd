Hi! I am Jessica. I am studying **Integrated Innovation** at [iii](https://www.cmu.edu/iii/index.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} which is known for its interdisciplinary education. I love bringing global users an ultimate product experience so I focus on understanding their needs and customize product features for them. In addition to my business background, I am learning about design thinking, data science and engineering skills that will allow me to launch successful global products.
