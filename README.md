# <span style="color:#9797C1">About me</span>
Hi! I am Jessica. I am studying **Integrated Innovation** at [iii](https://www.cmu.edu/iii/index.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} which is known for its interdisciplinary education. I love bringing global users an ultimate product experience so I focus on understanding their needs and customize product features for them. In addition to my business background, I am learning about design thinking, data science and engineering skills that will allow me to launch successful global products.

# <span style="color:#9797C1">What I hope to learn</span>
In a professional setting, I realized the importance of organizing and displaying the data to tell compelling stories to the management. Also nicely designed data visualizations enable us to discover new insights otherwise we wouldnâ€™t be able to notice. From this class, I would like to learn how to visualize data with appropriate colors and different types of charts to deliver my thoughts impactfully to the audiences. I expect I will also gain basic markup/HTML skills while I am creating my portfolio. (I feel like I already learned a lot!)
